Notes:  The generated hardware must contain the means to select the hardware being
generated. Perform this action with SW9 on the board.

When SW9 is High: Fatou and Julia sets
When SW9 is Low: Mandelbot set

When switching between fractals, you should also switch
between windowing areas, as to center the fractals in the screen.

Description:
1. We need to map points on the screen to points on the complex plane.
The VGA gives us a y-coorrdinate in lines, and the x-coordiantes as pixels in line

2. We need to translate the x and y values into a viewing range in the complex plane
C_w is the viewing range
    We denote this operations as M: (p, l) -> C_w
    For the resolution 480 x 640
    R{c} := 3.2 x p/640 
    I{c} := 2.2 x (240-l) / 480
    for the real and imaginary parts of the number, respectively

3. Pipeline Method:
Every clock cycle, pipeline output should yield the number of iterations for a particular point in the set
Pros: Higher resolutons images, no intermedia memory, can make use of high iteration count.

- Every stage of the pipeline performs the equivalent of one iteration.
- Every stage propogates the results of the square and accumulate operation to the next stage.
- Each stage performs comparison of the magnitude of current z to threshold.
- Pipeline propogates the result of the comparison and the pipeline stage number.
- If z > threshold: any subsequent stages of the pipeline propagate the stage number that has been sent to it.
Output of the pipeline will contain # of iterations for the seed c to escape.
- Use these numbers to index the color table.
- We can feed new seed c to the start of pipeline every clock cycle.

4. Parallel Vector Machine Method: (optional)
-  Implement multiple of computational units which perform complex multiplication and addition on a closed loop.
- Each computational unit uses an accumulator architecture
- We use multiple computational units and a control unit to schedule work to these computational units.
- Control unit also reads the output of the computational units to plot on the screen.
- When data is read from a computational unit, we seed it with a new point and let it iterate. 
Right after, move the next computational engine and perform the same process.

- when the control unit returns to a computational engine, its result must be ready
- if a computational unit needs at most k iterations
to determine if a point is part of the Mandelbrot or Julia/Fatou sets, then there must be at
least k computational units for the control unit to read and set up before returning to the
initial one.
