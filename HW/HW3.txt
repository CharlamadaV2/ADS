1.) How many colors can the board output through VGA interface?

3 colors RGB

2.) If we aim to drive our VGA output at a 640 × 480 resolution at a 60 Hz refresh
rate, what should the pixel clock rate be?

The pixel clock rate should be 25 MHz


4.) For a 640 × 480 resolution at a 60 Hz rate, provide the timings for the following
measures in the given               units
Horizontal front porch           16 pixels
Horizontal sync pulse width      96   pixels
Horizontal back porch            48   pixels
Vertical front porch             10   lines
Vertical sync pulse width        2   lines
Vertical back porch              33   lines
What is the polarity of the sync pulses on a 640 × 480 VGA resolution?

The polarity is Negative

5.) Given the timings in Question 4 and the clock rate in Question 2, what percentage
of the frame is spent in the blanking periods?
The timing 

16 + 96 + 48 = 160

160 / 640 * 100 = 25%

10 + 2 + 33 = 45
45 / 480 * 100 = 9.37%

6.)  If we allow a 4 bit framebuffer, that is a framebuffer where every
pixel only has a 4 bit color value, on a 640×480 resolution. How much memory do we need
to hold this data? Can we do double buffering at this resolution using only the on-chip
memory of the MAX 10 FPGA on the DE10-Lite board?

640 * 480 * 4 = 1,228,800 bits => 150 kB

Double buffering = 150 * 2 = 300 kB
No we can not, the manual says max 200kB

7.)  In the next two projects, we will work using a VGA output.
The second project will require the use of a 1920×1080 resolution driven at 60 Hz. Provide
the timing data for this resolution. What is the sync polarity?

The polarity is positive
