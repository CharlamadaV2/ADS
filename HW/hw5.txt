1.) Create an unconstrained array type which uses
the newly created record as the base type.

type seven_segment_config is record
    a : std_logic;
    b : std_logic;
    c : std_logic;
    d : std_logic;
    e : std_logic;
    f : std_logic;
    g : std_logic;
end record seven_segment_config;

type seven_segment_ucarray is array (natural range <>) of seven_segment_config;

2.) Construct an enumerated type called lamp_configuration which defines the names
common_anode and common_cathode. Define a constant of this enumerated type called default_lamp_config
and set it to the lamp configuration of your board.

type lamp_configuration is (common_anode, common_cathode);

constant default_lamp_config : lamp_configuration := common_anode;  

3.) Utilize the array from question 1 define a constant named seven_segment_table. 
Each seven_segment_config entry must describe the lamp configuration of a hexadecimal alphabet.

constant seven_segment_table : seven_segment_ucarray(0 to 15); 

4.) Declare a subtype of natural called hex_digit which is constrained to the range
of the constant created in the previous question. Use this subtype to construct a function
with the following prototype.

The function should use the seven_segment_table declared in Question 3 and return a
seven_segment_config entry which activates the lamps for the given lamp_mode configuration.

subtype hex_digit is natural range 0 to 15;

function get_hex_digit (
    digit : in hex_digit;
    lamp_mode : in lamp_configuration := default_lamp_config
) return seven_segment_config is
    variable result : seven_segment_config;
begin
    result := seven_segment_table(digit);  
    
    if lamp_mode = common_anode then
        result := not result;
    end if;
    
    return result;
end function get_hex_digit;


5.) Construct a function with the prototype which 
returns a seven_segment_config for the given lamp_mode so that all lamps are off.


function lamps_off (
    lamp_mode : in lamp_configuration := default_lamp_config
) return seven_segment_config is
    variable off_pattern : seven_segment_config;
begin
    case lamp_mode is
        when common_cathode =>
            off_pattern := "0000000";  -- All high (off for active-high)
        when common_anode =>
            off_pattern := "1111111";  -- All low (off for active-low)
    end case;
    
    return off_pattern;
end function lamps_off;

6.) Construct a list of lists in Tcl so that each internal list contains the FPGA pins for which the lamps on the seven segment displays are connected.

7.) Write a Tcl procedure called set_pins which takes in the number
of hex digits we wish to use as well as an optional name for the signal which connects to
the lamps. The procedure will issue the proper set_location_assignment directives so that
Quartus automatically performs pin placement. The procedure should use the previously
defined sseg_lamps variable. You may use the following snippet of code to get started.
